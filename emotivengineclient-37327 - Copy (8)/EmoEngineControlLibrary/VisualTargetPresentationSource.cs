    /// <remarks> Dwayne Need says: WPF provides a very convenient event called <see cref="Loaded"/>. 
    /// This event basically signals when an element has been fully initialized, measured, arranged, 
    /// rendered, and plugged into a presentation source (such as a <see cref="Window"/>). Many elements 
    /// use this event, including the MediaElement, but sadly this event is not raised for element trees 
    /// that are not plugged into a presentation source, and displaying an element tree through the 
    /// HostVisual/VisualTarget doesn’t count. So work around this, we make our own presentation source 
    /// and use it to root the element tree that the worker thread will own. This immediately leads into 
    /// another problem: layout is suspended on all elements until resumed by a presentation source.  
    /// Unfortunately, the official mechanism to do this is internal, so the best we can do is to explicitly 
    /// measure and arrange the root element.
